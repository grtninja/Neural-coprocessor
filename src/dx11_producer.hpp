// MGPU Bridge - the DX11 producer (0.3.0 R&D, R227; DX11_CONTRACT_LEDGER.md
// section 7).
//
// WHAT IT IS. The stream's ring, seals, cross-adapter heap, unpack, NR, SR
// and presenter are D3D12 objects on the GAME'S ADAPTER, not on the game's
// device. A D3D11 title has no D3D12 device, so this module owns one, on
// that adapter, and feeds the EXISTING producer (gpu1::stream_on_finish_
// effects) exactly what the D3D12 path feeds it: a command list, a queue and
// resources on a device whose adapter LUID is the game's. The producer
// derives its device from the colour resource and filters by LUID; both hold.
//
// THE HOP (proved by the probe, R225, TR-5b: zero wait on the game thread):
//   game's D3D11 immediate context  --CopyResource-->  shared NT-handle
//   textures (colour, depth) on the game's D3D11 device  --Signal-->  a
//   D3D11.4 shared fence  ==  its D3D12 twin  --queue Wait-->  our D3D12
//   device on the same adapter, where the producer records its copies into
//   the ring slot from the opened textures, and our queue executes them.
//
// NEVER WAITS ON THE GAME THREAD. The D3D11 side is copies and a Signal. The
// D3D12 side is GPU work only: Wait(fence), execute, Signal(gfence) by the
// producer at the next event, as on D3D12.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO IN THIS BUILD. Real vectors (MVec=3): the probe's bind
// hook and the calibrator's NGX tap are D3D12 in this build, so the module
// tells the stream to treat MVec=3 as the synthetic field (MVec=1) with a
// warning. Own Reflex: not wired to the D3D11 device yet. Both are the next
// items; neither blocks NR on screen.
//
// GATES. (1) dllmain calls in only from a D3D11 game device/swap chain
// (get_api() == d3d11); the D3D12 path never reaches this file, and init
// refuses a non-D3D11 native. (2) DX11=1 in mgpu.ini; absent = nothing is
// created and every call site is one load (R226 keeps a DX11 title inert).
// Holds no ReShade type: every interface arrives as a native void*.
